# Human Gesture and Gait Analysis for Autism Detection
Imagine transforming the way autism is diagnosed and revolutionizing early intervention strategies instead of waiting up to 2-years just to get the diagnosis. My AI solution analyses gait and gesture patterns, revealing unique autism traits. This innovative approach utilizes skeleton videos for private and non-intrusive autism prediction and severity assessments.
