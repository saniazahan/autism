# Human Gesture and Gait Analysis for Autism Detection
Imagine transforming the way autism is diagnosed and revolutionizing early intervention strategies instead of waiting up to 2-years just to get the diagnosis. My AI solution analyses gait and gesture patterns, revealing unique autism traits. This innovative approach utilizes skeleton videos for private and non-intrusive autism prediction and severity assessments.

## Illustration of asymmetry in the joints of the left and right sides of the body 
Left and right side joints are overlapped in TD samples whereas deviated in ASD samples, indicating that ASD children have asymmetric hand and leg positions during walking
